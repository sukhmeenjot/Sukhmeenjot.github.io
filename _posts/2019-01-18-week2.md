# Week 2
## [Topic for mini project presentation]({% post_url 2019-01-18-week1 %})
As I choose sketch for my mini project,I start working on project from this week (week 2). First of all , I get familiar with
sketch by reading stuff about it. Ihave watched lynda videos to start this software from the scratch. Then I thinkg about my 
design , what its gonna be look. I draw it roughly on my notebook. Now, its time to start working software. while I was working
on my project by using this software, actually I feel very comfortable with it. It is actually similar to other designing 
softwares. I made two desktop artboard. Which are wireframes for ttavelling website. During designing these wireframes, I use
many tools , like to insert shapes , images and many more. 

I was facing some problems during my work, major one was how to make my page responsive. The reason behind that, I was working 
on past version of sketch that is version 42. Then I consult my instructor about my problem. He gave me the solution to my 
problem, by suggesting to use the latest version of sketch. Now I am using lastest version. Hope I will learn more and more from 
this subject and  project. That's all I have done in this week.
