#Topic for mini project presentation
I choose SKECTH  topic for my first mini project presentation . The reason behind choosing this topic is that , it will help me in future to grow more in designing industry. After my research for the topic I find that, It is kind of combination of all designing softwares that we use in pervious semesters.  The second reason to choose this topic is that I am going to learn more about sketch in next semester. So, I want to prepare my self for that class.

I am going to design wireframe for traveling website by using sketch tool and try explore the sketch tools as much as I can.
