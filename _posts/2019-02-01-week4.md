# Week 4
## [Update for week 4]({% post_url 2019-02-01-week4 %})
Last week I was on the way to complete my mockups. This week, I created rest of my mockups. This week I face many problems 
as compare to last 3 weeks. My main problem is how to make my design responsive, I tried to figure out by myself by watching 
videos and searching on internet. But enable to find any solution. I am gonna consult my instructor about my problem. Furthermore,
I almost completed my design and start working on my presentation. I completed my user flow prototype too, which I am gonna show
during my presentation. That's all for this week and stepped in the last week of presentation.

# Plan for week next
Next week is last week of work, going to refine my mockups and fix the problems. Finsih my presentation and get ready for it.
