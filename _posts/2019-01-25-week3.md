# Week 3
## [Update for week 3]({% post_url 2019-01-25-week3 %})
Last week I made two mockup pages of my travel website. In this week I worked on other three mockup pages, in which I include some futher detials of last two pages and I also worked on landing page of my website. Past weeek, as I told , I exlpore some tools of skecth, but as compare to this week , I explore more about sketch tools, how they work and how we can use them to make excellent designs. This week I watched many sketch videos on You Tube and Lynda. During working on my mockups, I face many problems, because of its new plateform for me, but I solved those problems by searching on internet and watch videos about them. In this process I learned about many tools and plugins that we can use for advance graphic desgins. I did'nt use any plugins because I dont need them for my mockups , but I Know how to use them and what they are for. I learned about very specail tool that comes in new version of skecth that is Prototyping. Which is used to create prototype for user. It has some feature like you can choose the target and destination and then you can apply some animation on them. I really liked this software, and want to use in future for designs.

# Plan for next week 
In coming week, I am hoping that I will finsih my mockups and start working on some errors or refinments.
