# Week 3
## [Update of Week 3]({% post_url 2019-03-01-week3-Project2 %})
Last week , I told that I didnt decide my theme, but now I came up with the theme that I am going to make a poster for 
automobile company. For the poster I am going to use asymmetric design trend to make it more attractive for the customer look.The reason behind choosing this theme that while I was searching for my theme for the tutorial, I saw bill board of car advertisement they used really good color and some asymmertic design layout. Then at that time I decided that I am going to make poster for automobile company by using asymmertic design trend.
