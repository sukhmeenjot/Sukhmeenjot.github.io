# Week 3
## [Update of Week 3]({% post_url 2019-03-01-week3-Project2 %})
Last week , I told that I didnt decide my theme, but now I came up with the theme that I am going to make a poster for 
automobile company. By using asymmetric design trend I think it will look  more attractivee  for the customer .The reason behind choosing this theme that while I was searching for my theme for the tutorial, I saw bill board of car advertisement they used really good color and some asymmertic design layout. Then at that time I decided that I am going to make poster for automobile company by using asymmertic design trend. Automobile field is one of the most growing area towards future, I think asymmetric designs are the designs who represent the future image.That's why choose the combination of these two things to create somthing good and unique.  

# Progress

* Collected some data for my project.
* Created a draft layout.

# Next week Plan 
For the next week I am hoping that I will come up with final color Pallet and final layout.
