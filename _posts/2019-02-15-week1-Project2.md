## Design Trends


I choose Design Tend of 2019 topic for my second mini project tutorial. In design trend 2019 , I decided to go for Asymmetrical 
design. The reason to choose this topic is that I get inspired from Josu√© Menjivar guest lecture. He talked about asymmetrical
design that how they leading in the current world. I really like the asymmertic design because they are balance from both side 
and present the nice visual picture.

### Deliverables
