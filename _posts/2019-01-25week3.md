# Week 3
## [Update for week 3]({% post_url 2019-01-25-week3 %})
Last week I made two wireframe pages of my travel website. In this week I worked on other three wireframe pages, in which i include some futher detials of last two pages and i also worked on landing page of my website. Past weeek, as I told , I exlpore some tools of skecth, but as compare to this week , I explore more about sketch tools. how they work and how we can use them to make excellent designs. This week watched many sketch videos on You Tube and Lynda. During working on my wireframes, I face my problems, because of its new plateform for me, but I solved those problems by searching and watch videos about them.
