## [Update for week 7]({% post_url 2019-03-29-week7-Project2 %})
I finished my project 2, It was Poster for car showroom opening. I already uploaded the tutorial for more details that how I
created the poster. To Evaluate my progess with respect to intial goals, I would I like to say that I meet 99% my goals. This time, I lack with only 1% , because at the begining I choosed wrong software. Overall , this time project goes really well. In this project I almost meet my expectations, but as expectations for the project change over time , in this project design part took more part, because it was alot to search about asymmetric design trends. I tried various color palette and design to go with my poster. That's the part where time effected my project.

# Lessons Learned
I have learned many lessons, which are given below:-

## Asymmetric Design Trend 

1. Asymmetrical design are also implied in real life. It also come in notice, that asymmetrical design fundamentals are also used for interior designing . Many interior designer follows this trend to decorate home and offices.
2. I learned that asymmetric desgins  are very wide and currently they are counted in latest trend.
3. I also learned that , you can modify asymmetric design according to your topic, they are very comfortable to go with any
theme.

## During Project
1. I learned many lessons , during working on my project. For a good design, you need good platform , the one you are feeling  comfortable with.
2. I also learned that whenever you are working on design,try everything which comes in your mind ,because you never konw what's gona catch your eye.
3. I also learned many tools in illustrator, like blend tool, I never used blend tool before that project. 
4. I also explore many artboard option available in illustrator and more menu options available.
5. During working on fonts for my project, I also learned one new thing that, you can give shadow effect to text without using shadow tool. You just need to play with fonts position.

## Problems
1. The first problem I faced by choosing wrong software. At the beginning choose sketch to create my poster, but sketch was missing many things, which I need for my project. And also I was less familiar with the Sketch. But, then I moved to Adobe Ilustrator.
2. I had little stuck, to choose color palette for my project and also for image part.

Everything else goes very smooth and well during whole project.


# Future Work
I really like working on poster, It was kind of different experience for me to create somthing like that, before that I  created mockups and logos by using Asymmetric design trends. I think, for future, I am going to use Asymmetric design trend for more things like to design  book covers, fashion clothes and for interior designing. In future , I am going try more Asymmetric designs and also play with them.
