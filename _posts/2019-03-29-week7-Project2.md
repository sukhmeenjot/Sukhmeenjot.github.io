# Week 7
## [Update for week 7]({% post_url 2019-03-29-week7-Project2 %})
I finished my project 2, It was Poster for car showroom opening. I already uploaded the tutorial for more details that how I
created the poster. To Evaluate my progess with respect to intial goals, I would I like to say that I meet 99% my goals. This time, I lack with only 1% , because at the begining I choosed wrong software. Overall , this time project goes really well. In this project I almost meet my expectations, but as expectations for the project change over time , in this project design part took more part, because it was alot to search about asymmetric design trends. I tried various color pallete and design to go with my poster. That's the part where time effected my project.

# Lessons Learned
I have learned many lessons, like asymmetric 




I have Learned so many lessons during this project, for example the reizing to cannot make your design fully responsive, it 
just fix the position of your icons and other items. I also learn many lessons like that never give up on searching new thing.
It will help you alot to improve your design and imaginations. There was only one unexpected challenge that I faced during 
work is that my free trail end way before than actual end date, like I get only 5 day free trail instead of 30 day. It is generally 30 day free trail.

# Future Work
I have some future plans to use this software. Currently I am working on one project with my team. I think I can use this software to help them to create some good mockups for our project website. Rather than that I am thinking to use this software 
for rest of carrier, so that I will dig more into this software. Its really good for deginers and I see myself as a good future designer.
