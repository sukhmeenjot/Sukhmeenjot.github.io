# Week 7
## [Update for week 7]({% post_url 2019-03-29-week7-Project2 %})
I finished my project 2, It was Poster for car showroom opening. I already uploaded the tutorial for more details that how I
created the poster. To Evaluate my progess with respect to intial goals, I would I like to say that I meet 99% my goals. This time lack with only 1% , because at the begining I choosed wrong software. Overall , this time project goes really well. In this project I almost meet my expectations, but as expectations for the project change over time 

Today is the last day of my Mini project. I am going to present in the class what I have done so far. To Evaluate my progess 
with respect to intial goals, I would I like to say that I meet 95% my goals. Only 5% of my goals is effected, because of 
time. To talk about expectations for the project change over time is like that,Intially I was thinking to create whole mockup
for travelling website, including all Desktop , Tablet and Mobile views. But its all change over  time, I just created  
Desktop view and one Mobile view. That is how my project effected by time.

# Lessons Learned
I have Learned so many lessons during this project, for example the reizing to cannot make your design fully responsive, it 
just fix the position of your icons and other items. I also learn many lessons like that never give up on searching new thing.
It will help you alot to improve your design and imaginations. There was only one unexpected challenge that I faced during 
work is that my free trail end way before than actual end date, like I get only 5 day free trail instead of 30 day. It is generally 30 day free trail.

# Future Work
I have some future plans to use this software. Currently I am working on one project with my team. I think I can use this software to help them to create some good mockups for our project website. Rather than that I am thinking to use this software 
for rest of carrier, so that I will dig more into this software. Its really good for deginers and I see myself as a good future designer.
