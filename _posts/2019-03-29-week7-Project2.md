# Week 7
## [Update for week 7]({% post_url 2019-03-29-week7-Project2 %})
I finished my project 2, It was Poster for car showroom opening. I already uploaded the tutorial for more details that how I
created the poster. To Evaluate my progess with respect to intial goals, I would I like to say that I meet 99% my goals. This time, I lack with only 1% , because at the begining I choosed wrong software. Overall , this time project goes really well. In this project I almost meet my expectations, but as expectations for the project change over time , in this project design part took more part, because it was alot to search about asymmetric design trends. I tried various color pallete and design to go with my poster. That's the part where time effected my project.

# Lessons Learned
I have learned many lessons, which are given below:-

## Asymmetric Design Trend 

1. Asymmetrical design are also implied in real life. It also come in notice, that asymmetrical design fundamentals are also used for interior designing . Many interior designer follows this trend to decorate home and offices.
2. I learned that asymmetric desgin trend are very wide and currently they are counted in latest trend.
3. I also learned that , you can modify asymmetric design according to your topic, they are very comfortable to go with any
design.

## During Project
1. I learned many lessons , during working on my project. For a good design, you need good platform , the one you are feeling  comfortable with.
2. I also learned that whenever you are working on design,try everything which comes in your mind ,because you never konw what's gona catch your eye.
3. I also learned many tools in illustrator, like blend tool, I never used blend tool before that project. 
4. I also explore many artboard option available in illustrator and more menu options available.
5. During working on fonts for my project, I also learned one new thing that, you can give shadow effect to text without using shadow tool. You just need to play with fonts position.

## Problems
1. The first problem I faced by choosing wrong software. At the beginning choose sketch to create my poster, but sketch was missing many things, which I need for my project. And also I was less familiar with the Sketch. But, then I moved to Adobe Ilustrator.








I have Learned so many lessons during this project, for example the reizing to cannot make your design fully responsive, it 
just fix the position of your icons and other items. I also learn many lessons like that never give up on searching new thing.
It will help you alot to improve your design and imaginations. There was only one unexpected challenge that I faced during 
work is that my free trail end way before than actual end date, like I get only 5 day free trail instead of 30 day. It is generally 30 day free trail.

# Future Work
I have some future plans to use this software. Currently I am working on one project with my team. I think I can use this software to help them to create some good mockups for our project website. Rather than that I am thinking to use this software 
for rest of carrier, so that I will dig more into this software. Its really good for deginers and I see myself as a good future designer.
