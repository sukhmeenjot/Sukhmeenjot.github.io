# Week 5
## [Update of Week 5]({% post_url 2019-03-15-week5-Project2 %})
This week I finally complete the layout, It takes alot of time because firstly I started designing with Sketch Software, but
I was not that much familiar with that software, at the first I just wanna give try do to my project by using Sketch. During
the project I stuck with alot of tools and also there are some features that are missing. For example I want to used blend and tracing Image tool for my layout part but I couldn't find it in the sketch. So, I decided to go with the Adobe Illustrator. I am very much comfortable with Illustrator, and it takes less time then sketch. This week I changed the layout too, because I made alot of changes that I want to do. 

# Progress
* Switch from Sketch to Illustrator.
* Complete the final Layout.
* Final color palette.

# Next week Plan 
For the next week, I am going create a final draft poster by insterting image and typography .
