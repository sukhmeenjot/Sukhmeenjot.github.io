# Week 6
## [Update of Week 6]({% post_url 2019-03-21-week6-Project2 %})
This week I almost complete poster. During week, I did work on tracing the image for my poster and also I worked on typography. I tried many fonts family for typography, and finalize the one who's going with my theme. I also fixed my design like so that everything looks good and balanced. Just a little bit touch up needed for typography.
